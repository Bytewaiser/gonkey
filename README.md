# Ronkey Programming Language

Its like monkey language but written in Rust

# Why

Because I had problems while solving the Advent of Code 2022 with the lack of knowledge in creating parsers

The best way to learn about them is to create a programming language

## Why Rust

Because it is statically typed and I want to become proficient at Rust (I am a real beginner)
